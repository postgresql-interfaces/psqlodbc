5.Not call show max_identifier_length in PG 7.4.
6.Change adjustLikePattern() to take literal quote(') into account.
7.Fix a bug in memory debug routine.
8.Change the multibyte encoding list to match that of the current
  official driver.
9.Change SC_clear_error() to call CC_clear_error() also.
10.Change the length values returned when they are unknown for
   SQLDescribeCol or SQLColAttribute requests.

[7.3.0261]

1.Fix the handling of *too small buffer* in the Unicode version.
2.Fix the behavior of DiscardStatementSvp which resets the status too early.
3.Fix the bug in PGAPI_ParamData which fails to count the number
  of parameters.
4.Allow blanks in password.
5.Add an option to force abbreviation of connection string.
6.Fix the handling of "PROTOCOL=x.x-x" in the connection string.
7.Fix the loadlib module of *nix.

[7.3.0260]

1. Change delay load import library mechanism(libpq,openssl)
2. Compile Optimization correspondence.
3. SQLForeignKeys ResultSet accuracy correspondence.

[7.3.0258]

1. bug fix: SQLBulkOperations rollback option.
   There was a case where a rollback was not published in SQLBulkOperations
   as option specification at the time of error generating.

[7.3.0257]

1. Fault correction of the division SQLGetData to SQL_C_WCHAR.

[7.3.0256]

1. SQLSetPos does not position to current-row to renewal of unblock cursor.
   (Data is unacquirable by SQLGetData etc.)

   It rejects using information_schema.column_privileges.
2. Binary mode is used for a bytea type parameter value setup.
   (Performs by the sequence of SQLPrepare->SQLExecute by server_side_prepare employment)
3. Coexistence of LO type and bytea type.
   When the parameter of LongVarBinary exists not by SQLPrepare->SQLExecute but by
   SQLExecDirect at the time of direct dispatching, the Parse/Describe function of
   a protocol 3 is used, the model in saver of LongVarBinary is acquired beforehand,
   and a bytea type and LO type are recognized.

[Feature of Driver7.3.025x]

1. Correspondence protocol 3
   Options, such as client encoding, are set up by the start-up packet.
   This makes the most of the mechanism of Parse/Bind/Execute.
   .The outfit of SQLDescribeParam
   .PREPARE/EXECUTE is changed from the command base to the protocol base.
   .FETCH command is changed to an Execute request as it has come out.
   .Moreover, bytea and lo type coexistence is possible.
   .Others...

2. Enhancement in declare/fetch mode (7.4 or later)
   Even if a certain renewal occurs on the way by holdable cursor exploitation,
   a commitment is possible in comfort.
   Moreover, the static update cursor was supported.
   (Only for SQLSetPos correspondence, SQLBulkOperation are un-supporting)
   Bug fix of the cursor which can be updated.

3. Rollback support of a syntactical unit at the time of an error.(8.0 or later)
   Can choose from three Transaction module,Statement module,Nothing.
   These can be specified by data source setup.

4. Output parameter support (8.1 or later)
   Corresponded to the output parameter of the function introduced by 8.1.
   (Only the return value of a function was supported before.)

08.01.0200 - Stable<br>
08.01.0201 - Development<br>
...<br>
...<br>
08.01.0299 - Development<br>
08.01.0300 - Stable<br>

<br>
<li>Notes: psqlODBC 08.01.0101</li><br>
Changes:<br>
This release fixes a serious problem in non-declare/fetch mode where<br>
recordsets over the configured declare/fetch cache size were returned<br>
incorrectly. It is advised that all users of v08.01.0100 upgrade as soon<br>
as possible.<br>
<br>
<h2>psqlODBC 08.01.0100 Release</h2>
This release represents a major change to the driver over previous versions;<br>
in particular, the network code has been replaced with the PostgreSQL libpq<br>
library. This allows us to more easily take advantage of updates and new<br>
features that might be introduced to the PostgreSQL wire protocol, and also<br>
allowed us to upgrade straight away to the version 3 protocol which was<br>
previously unsupported. We were also able to add SSL support, as well as<br>
Kerberos authentication support.<br>
<br>
>From this release, two versions of the driver are provided for Windows,<br>
'PostgreSQL ANSI' which supports single and multibyte applications through<br>
the ANSI ODBC API, and 'PostgreSQL Unicode' which provides Unicode support<br>
through the Unicode ODBC API. On Unix systems, the driver type may be<br>
selected via a configure option.<br>
<br>
psqlODBC may be downloaded from http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/<br>
in source, Windows Installer, merge module, and basic zip file formats.<br>
<br>
Please post any bug reports to the pgsql-odbc@postgresql.org mailing list.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all those involved with the<br>
development, testing and bug fixing of the updated driver.<br>
PostgreSQL Core Team<br>
<br>
<li>Notes: psqlODBC 08.00.0102</li><br>
This is a bug fix release<br>
of the pre-libpq version of the driver, specifically to fix a bug<br>
affecting Unix users<br>
(http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/psqlodbc/bugs/bugupdate.php?1176)<br>
<br>
<h2>psqlODBC 08.00.0100 Release</h2>
The driver is available in source form, as well as a dll, merge module<br>
and msi installer for Windows.<br>
<br>
Regards, Dave.<br>
<br>
<li>Notes: psqlODBC 08.00.0005</li><br>
This version<br>
contains a some recent fixes, and is packaged in a new installer built<br>
entirely using open source tools (specifically, the Wix toolkit).<br>
<br>
<li>Notes: psqlODBC 08.00.0002</li><br>
This version of the driver is a minor update<br>
with a fix to the string sizing code in SQLGetInfo, and removal of the<br>
need for tables to be in the search path or public schema for them to be<br>
returned by SQLTables.<br>
<br>
<li>Notes: psqlODBC 08.00.0001</li><br>
The purpose of this version is to try to get something stable, with<br>
proper schema/without OID support ready for the 8.0 release<br>
(particularly the win32 release). To that end, this release is mainly a<br>
quick cleanup of the following:<br>
<br>
- GUI cleanup. Dialogues should behave better now and not have unlabeled<br>
buttons or move around the screen in strange ways.<br>
<br>
- Updateable Cursor support. This is largely experimental and is (I<br>
believe) the cause of a least a couple of stability issues in the recent<br>
snapshots. In this release it is marked 'experimental' on the setup<br>
dialogue (only in English, if anyone can do the Japanese version, please<br>
send a patch) and turned off by default.<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate it if ppl could test it a little with Updateable Cursors<br>
*turned off* and report any bugs.<br>
<br>
<h2>psqlODBC 07.05.0001</h2>
This is version 07.05.0001. For those that don't know or don't recall<br>
how the versioning works, the major and minor number track the latest<br>
release of PostgreSQL that the driver is expected to work with. The<br>
revision number is a bit more complex. The first two digits are the<br>
version number, where even numbers are development versions, and odd are<br>
release. The last two digits are the build number.<br>
<br>
In other words, this driver is build 01 of development version 00, and<br>
is expected to work with PostgreSQL 7.5dev. :-) The leading zeros are an<br>
ODBC thing...<br>
<br>
<h2>psqlODBC 07.03.0100 Release</h2>
I'm pleased to announce the long awaited new version of psqlODBC. This<br>
release represents a major change in the packaging and distribution of<br>
psqlODBC. In particular the following points should be noted:<br>
<br>
1) The build number will now be used to indicate both the release number<br>
(first 2 digits), and snapshot build number (last 2 digits). this<br>
release is 0100, or release 1, snapshot 0. The first development<br>
snapshot will become 0101, the second 0102 and so on. The next official<br>
release should be 07.03.0200.<br>
<br>
2) With this release, the ODBC 3 driver is now the default. The<br>
filenames, driver names and their capabilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
psqlodbc.dll PostgreSQL ODBC3.0 Level<br>
driver<br>
psqlodbc25.dll PostgreSQL Legacy ODBC2.5 Level<br>
driver<br>
psqlodbc30w.dll PostgreSQL Unicode (Beta) Beta quality ODBC3.0<br>
level driver with Unicode support<br>
<br>
3) The 3 drivers are no longer self contained. psqlodbc.dll is used as<br>
the setup dll for all three drivers, hence no matter how you<br>
redistribute or install the drivers, you should always include this<br>
file.<br>
<br>
In addition, this driver fixes an annoying problem with recent builds of<br>
PostgreSQL on Redhat systems that have a particularly long compiler<br>
version string that caused a buffer overflow resulting in a GPF on<br>
Windows upon connection to the database.<br>
The driver is released under the LGPL, and can be downloaded from the<br>
Downloads page on the website at<br>
http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/psqlodbc/projdisplay.php<br>
