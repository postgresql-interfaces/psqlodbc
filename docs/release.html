<h2><a id="09.03.0100">psqlODBC 09.03.0100 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />

<ol type="1">
<li><b> Fix uninitialized use of 'allocbuf' variable, in case of out-of-memory.</b><br /></li>
Compiler warned about this. If ENLARGE_NEWSTATEMENT macro ran out of memory, it would jump to cleanup routine. <br />
The cleanup would check if allocbuf isNULL, and try to free() it if not. <br />
allocbuf needs to be initialized to NULL before the first ENLARGE_NEWSTATEMENT macro invocation.<br />
<li><b> SQL_C_SLONG stands for SQLINTEGER not long.</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Change SQL_ATTR_PARAMS_PROCESSED_PTR attribute which is set by SQLSetStmtAttr() from (SQLUINTEGER *) to (SQLULEN *).</b><br /></li> 
This fixes the bug reported by Christopf Berg. <br />
Also verify similar attributes which were changed from SQL(U)INTEGER (*) to SQL(U)LEN (*) when 64bit ODBC was introduced.<br />
<li><b> Reduce the memory usage of ConnectinClass objects by changing their large fixed length text fields to variable ones.</b><br /></li>
Because changes are applied to percent-encoded fields this time, password field is also a target of this.<br />
<li><b> Revise MSDTC support.</b><br /></li>
  Remove pointlessly complicated AsyncThreads stuff. Instead use _beginthread() to clean up threads.<br />
  Make pgenlist.dll from the structure change of ConnectionClass.<br />
    The driver dlls exports the functions described in connexp.h which are used by pgenlist.dll.<br />
  Isolate the current communication path if necessary.<br />
    While an IAsyncPG object is alive, a ConnectionClass object (hereinafter refered to as conn-obj) is assigned to it. <br />
    The assignment has to be changed in the following cases.<br />
<ol  type="a">
<li> SQLDisconnect() is called for the current connection handle which is assigned to an IAsyncPG object.</li>
	Allocate another conn-obj and move the current communication path (*sock* member of the current conn-obj) to the new conn-obj.
	The communicaation path is lost from the current conn-obj and the new conn-obj is assigned to the IAsyncPG object.<br />
<li> Another (global) transaction is about to begin but the current global transaction is not PREPARED yet.</li>
	Same as case a) but will open a new communication path for the current conn-obj for the subsequent ODBC API calls.<br />
<li> Another (global) transaction is about to begin and the current global transaction is already PREPARED.</li>
	Allocate another conn-obj and open a new communication path for the conn-obj.
        The new conn-obj is assigned to the IAsyncPG object only to issue COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED command.
   communication pass (*sock* member of the current ConnectionClass object) to the new object and change the state of the current object NOT CONNECTED.
   The IAsyncPG object uses new object instead of the current object. In case b) the current object will open a new communication path.<br />
</ol>
</li>
<li><b> Ignore automatically-generated files in source code with .gitignore.</b><br/ ></li>
 This is useful to prevent accidental commit of files that are not wanted in the remote repository.<br />
 The original patch was provided by MichaelPaquier. I also added files genearated by VC build tools or WIX tools to .gitignore.<br />
<li><b> The first cut of psqlodbc setup project. It builds a setup program which can't be done by a single MSI. </b><br /></li>
 It would install VC++ redistributable, 32 bit psqlodbc driver and 64 bit psqlodbc driver (on 64 bit windows).</b><br /></li>
<li><b>Change the configure.ac </b><br /></li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Change checking SIZEOF_LONG not SIZEOF_LONG_INT.</li>
<li>with_xxxxx (xxxxx is the package name) variables directly instead of the withval variable.</li>
<li>Improve the help message of configure script.</li>
<li>Stop linking lib(i)odbc library because the library is unnecessary and rather harmful. </li>
Per report from Pavel Raiskup(postgresql.org/message-id/1769926.65KUyECjFr@nb.usersys.redhat.com).<br />
<li>Move -Wall -Wno-pointer-sign CFLAGS option specified in Makefile.am to configure.ac. </li>
<li>ODBC_CONFIG is set when neither unixODBC nor iODBC is explicitly specified.</li>
</ol>

<li><b> Silence misc compiler warnings. Also a few comment typo and whitespace fixes.</b><br /></li>
<li><b> CC_Copy is needed if _HANDLE_ENLIST_IN_DTC_ is used, regardless of CLEANUP_CONN_BEFORE_ISOLATION.</b><br /></li>
 That caused compilation on Windows to fail.<br />
<li><b> Remove some dead code.(SOCK_clear_error, SOCK_skip_n_bytes)</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Handle turning standard_conforming_strings to off in mid-session.</b><br /></li>
 We already watched for a ParameterStatus response indicating that standard_conforming_strings was turned on, and acted accordingly, but if it was turned off, we did nothing.<br />
<li><b> Remove common.o on "make clean"</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Change the default for UseServerSidePrepare to 1.</b><br /></li>
 The docs have recommended UseServerSidePrepare=1 for server versions 7.4 onwards, so it seems prudent to change the default so that people don't needto remember to specify it manually.<br />
 With UseServerSidePrepare=1, the "insertreturning" regression test case behaves better, ie.<br />
 SQLNumResultCols() correctly returns the number of columns for an INSERT RETURNING statement, even when called before SQLExecute(). <br />
<li><b> Remove useless 'sync' parameter from prepareParameters() function. It was always passed as TRUE.</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Don't issue a BEGIN when running VACUUM in auto-commit mode.</b><br /></li>
Normally in auto-commit mode the driver begins a new transaction implicitly at the first statement, by sending a BEGIN statement. However,
some commands, like VACUUM, cannot be run in a transaction block, and you will get an error like "VACUUM cannot run inside a transaction block" from
the server. In UseServerSidePrepare=0 mode, the code looks at the first word of the query to determine if the statement is one of the special ones, and
if so, didn't begin a new transaction even when auto-commit mode is disabled. However, in UseServerSidePrepare=1 mode, when using SQLPrepare/
SQLExecute to run the VACUUM, that check was not made. Fix that.
There was one more related inconsistency between UseServerSidePrepare modes. Without server-side-prepares, if you issued an explicit BEGIN in auto-commit
mode, the implicit BEGIN was ont sent. But without server-side prepares, it was. It seems best to send the implicit BEGIN in both cases, because then
you get a warning from the backend about the second BEGIN. That's a good thing, because a sane ODBC application should be using the ODBC function
SQLEndTran() for transaction control, not explicit BEGIN/COMMIT.<br />
<li><b> When LF->CR+LF conversion causes an buffer truncation, supress the conversion (in case of unicode).</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Handle SSL client certificate authentication in Windows Schannel security support provider.</b><br /></li>
You have to place the certificate file postgresql.pfx (PFX or PKCS12 format)
 in %APPDATA%\postgresql folder instead of postgresql.crt and postgresql.key
(I wasn't able to find the way to handle PEM format using Cryptography API unfortunately).<br />
You can create the file using the following command.<br />
<em>openssl pkcs12 -export -in postgresql.crt -inkey postgresql.key -out postgresql.pfx (with empty password).</em><br />
<li><b> Change Windows installer build system for the next release.</b><br /></li>
Change to specify ProductCode for each version so as not to forget to change ProductCode in case of major version up.
Remove VC runtime merge modules from the installer(runtime dlls will be installed via psqlodbc setup program).<br />
[64bit version only] Use libpq by default Remove GSSAPI support by default<br />
<li><b>Concentrate the settings of Windows build system to an xml file and build binaries or installers with reference to it.</b><br /></li>
(configuration.xml) xml file to specify the setting of the build environment.
It is automatically generated in winbuild folder as a copy of winbuild/configuration_template.xml
 when you invoke editConfiguration script firstly.<br />
<em>.winbuild/configuration.ps1</em>	modules to handle the configuration file<br />
<em>.winbuild/editConfiguration.ps1</em>	edit configuration file (GUI)<br />
<em>.winbuild/editConfiguration.bat</em>	same as above with a minimized console window<br />
<em>.buildx86.ps1</em>			build 32bit binary<br />
<em>.buildx64.ps1</em>			build 64bit binary<br />
<em>.installer/buildx86-installer.ps1</em>	build 32bit installer<br />
<em>.installer/buildx64-installer.ps1</em>	build 64bit installer<br />
<li><b> handle private keys of PEM form using CryptoAPI.</b><br /></li>
Certificates of PFX form are no longer needed for SSL client certificate authntication.<br />
<li><b>Fix a bug in CC_copy_conninfo() that free()s password item of input source unexpectedly.</b><br /></li>
Change CC_copy_conninfo() and copy_globals() so that they copy each item one by one.<br />
<li><b>Fix the newly-introduced CORR_STRCPY and CORR_VALCPY macros.</b><br /></li>
They were broken, did not compile. This fixed by Michael Paquier.<br />
<li><b>Add support for verify-ca/full sslmode using Windows Schannel Security Service Provider.</b><br /></li>
Root CAs must be installed into Windows Root certificate store beforehand.<br />
<li><b> VOID is not defined on all systems. Use void insted.</b><br /></li>
This fixed by Christoph Berg.<br />
<li><b> winres.h instead of afxres.h.</b><br /></li>
There are some cases (VS 2012 express etc) when afxres.h doesn't exist.<br />
<li><b> Avoid double-free() bug.</b><br /></li>
Spotted by Fortify static analysis tool.<br />
<li><b> Escape double-quotes in table name correctly.</b><br /></li>
When constructing the select/update/delete for current row in a rowset,
and the schema or table name contained double-quotes, they were not correctly escaped in the constructed SQL statement.
 That lead to errors when doing positioned updates. Also, use snprintf and snprintf_add instead of sprintf and strcat in more
 places. Makes these things look less like buffer overflows to static analysis tools, and make for more readable code anyway.<br />
<li><b> Construct ctid string correctly for block no > 2^31.</b><br /></li>
Block number is unsigned. Other places where we construct ctid strings we got this right, but not this one.
 I'm not sure how to trigger this codepath,
but I'm sure something funny would happen if you tried to use these functions on large enough tables (> 16 TB).<br />
<li><b> Fix buffer overflow in interval parsing.</b><br /></li>
Flagged by Fortify static analysis tool.<br />
<li><b> Check return value of stdup() for out-of-memory.</b><br /></li>
There are a lot of little bugs like this throughout the code, but it's start...<br />
<li><b> Replace calls to my_strcat and my_strcat with snprintf_add.</b><br /></li>
my_strcat didn't check for buffer overflow, which Fortify static analysis tool flagged as an issue. <br />
<li><b> Fix buffer overflow in handling of SQLTables params.</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Use snprintf() instead of sprintf() for safety.</b><br /></li>
I believe these instances were in fact safe, because a cursor name has a maximum length.<br />
<li><b> bufferoverflowu.lib seems no longer needed in recent versions of VC environment.</b><br /></li>
removed it from win64.mak. Speocify CUSTOMLINKLIBS=bufferoverflowu.lib from the command line when it is neccessary in old VC environment.<br />
<li><b> Fix memset() call, meant to clear the whole struct.</b><br /></li>
Per compiler warning.(psqlodbc.c)<br />
<li><b> socket: speedup also ipv6 connection</b><br /></li>
Call getaddrinfo() with AI_NUMERICHOST if it is ipv4/ipv6 address.
For that reason the inet_pton() is better than inet_addr().<br />
This fixed by Pavel Raiskup<br />
<li><b>Call getaddrinfo() with AI_NUMERICSERV because the service is a port number.</b><br /></li>
<li><b>Fixed lost mylog.h in Makefile.am.</b><br /></li>
This fixed by Pavel Raiskup<br />

<h2><a id="09.02.0100">psqlODBC 09.02.0100 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
1.) Protect shared connection list when making cleanup tasks in EN_Destructor
using the patch provided by Michael Kocherov.<br />
2.) Fix a lot of compiler warnings. Most of them were harmless, but some pointed
    to real, but rare, bugs.<br />
3.) Check SIZEOF_LONG_INT, rather than SIZEOF_VOID_P, when deciding whether
    SQLROWSETSIZE exists. That's consistent with unixodbc's sqltypes.h.<br />
4.) Check BUILD_LEGACY_64_BIT_MODE instead of BUILD_REAL_64_BIT_MODE. This
    makes us choose correctly whether we're building a 32-bit or 64-bit version,
    when building with unixODBC version 2.2.13 or higher.<br />
5.) Fix handling of some out-of-memory situations.<br />
6.) Eliminate recursion when freeing result sets of queries with
    array-bound parameters. This avoids running out of stack space on
    SQLFreeHandle, and speeds it up considerably.<br />
7.) Fix memory leak, e.g when SQLNumResultCols is called on a non-SELECT query.
    This was caused by unintentional multiple evaluation of macro arguments.<br />
8.) Move psqlodbc website's main page, FAQ, and howto pages to a separate git
    repository. They are no longer included in psqldbc release tarballs.<br />
9.) Fix bug with binding a 5-bytes long string as VARCHAR parameter, with
    UseServerSidePrepare=0 and BoolsAsChar=1. That combination produced an
    extra empty result set on execution.<br />
10.) Make the MSI build process of 32bit drivers available in 64bit.<br />
11.) Fix bug with DeUseDeclareFetch=1 and UseServerSidePrepare=1, issue COMMIT commands properly in case of AUTOCOMMIT on mode. per reported by Jack Wilson(ljwilson@digitalav.com).<br />
12.) Don't #include errno.h on Windows. VC10 or later intentionally changed the values of error numbers like EINTR, EWOULDBLOCK.<br />
13.) Allow special characters in the password value of a connection string by enclosing the value by braces({}).<br />
14.) Fixed conflict between winsock2.h and winsock.h in socket.c.<br />
15.)Apply blank date <-> null conversion functionality to timestamp type as well.<br />
16.) Fix the *cursor XXXXXXXX already exists* error when handling *with cte* statements reported by Joe Conway.<br />
17.) Fixed the problem *Segmentation Fault in Postgres server when using psqlODBC* reported by Joshua Berry.<br />
18.) Fixed the problem *UseDeclareFetch=1, Fetch=100, UseServerSidePrepare=1 causes Windows client to intermittently hang* reported by Jack Wilson.<br />
<br />
