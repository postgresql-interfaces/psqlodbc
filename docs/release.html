</ol>
<h2><a id="16.00.0000">psqlODBC 16.00.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Use autoconf to check for stdbool.h.</li>
<li>Make it possible to use standard bool on Windows.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="15.00.0000">psqlODBC 15.00.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Fix a bug that SQLGetDiagField(SQL_DIAG_NUMBER) with SQL_HANDLE_DBC returns SQL_NO_DATA even if an error record exists.</li>
<li>Fix a typo "RECISION"  which should be "PRECISION".</li>
<li>Enable SQLColumnPrivileges functionality.</li>
<li>Currently SQLColumnPrivileges() call fails. Fix a typo which is the cause.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that SQLColAttribute returns wrong column name.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="13.02.0000">psqlODBC 13.02.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Fix a bug of CC_send_query_append() when the ignore_roundtrip_time flag is onRemove a mylog() call which is a duplicate of the preceding MYLOG() macro call.</li>
Also direct use of mylog() should be avoided because mylog() uses lots of CPU.
<li>Noticed that the password field on the PostgreSQL Connection</li>
dialog is always focused when empty, even when other fields that appear
earlier on the dialog (and in the tab order) are empty. This is only a
minor annoyance, but it does seem like it would be contrary to the
expectation of most users.
I would propose separating the conditional to inform the user that the
password is required, but still focus the first empty field.
<li>Remove REFCUR_SUPPORT, add FetchRefcursors setting</li>
<li>Support fetching results from multiple refcursors</li>
Multiple result sets are returned if multiple refcursors are found
Works with both ODBC CALL and PostgreSQL CALL syntaxes
Query must be executed in a transaction to avoid cursors being closed
Now works when output parameters are present.
<li>Named parameter binding support</li>
<li>Use ODBC 3 column names for the result set of catalog functions.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="13.01.0000">psqlODBC 13.01.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Fix a bug of CC_send_query_append() when the ignore_roundtrip_time flag is on.</li>
<li>Add a call for SQLDescribeCol() before SQLExecute() to prepare-test.</li>
The diff of the result was reported by Mangold Fabian and will be fixed in the later commit.
<li>Add a *update returning* test case to insertreturning regression test.</li>
The diff of the result was reported by Patrick Cheung and will be fixed
in the later commit.
<li>Let SQLDescribeCol() use parsed result when the current executed result is NULL.</li>
This change fixes the diff of prepare-test regression test reported by Mangold Fabian.
<li>Let SQLExecute() destroy the old result first.</li>
This change fixes the diff of insertreturning-test regression test reported by Patrick Cheung.
<li>Forget to apply disable_convert_func flag to VARCHAR and LONGVARCHAR.</li>
<li>Prioritize DISABLE_KEEPALIVE checkbox over the disable_keepalive bit of ExtraOptions.</li>
<li>Format check for ExtraOptions of setup dialog.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="13.00.0000">psqlODBC 13.00.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Add support for CONVERT scalar function.</li>
<li>Cope with the case that openssl libraries link msvc runtimes other than libraries which psqlodbc or libpq links.</li>
<li>Call AC_CHECK_SIZEOF() or AC_CHECK_TYPES() macros at earlier stage where LIBS variable isn't set yet.</li>
These macros compile and run some programs. On some platforms(with some linker options like
--no-as-needed in Lnux Gnu linker) the programs try to link libraries specified by LIBS variable at run time.
There are some cases that the programs fail due to missing library which is actually not needed and AC_CHECK_SIZEOF() returns 0.
<li>Fix a compilation error with GCC 10 due to conflicting variable names.</li>
Patch by Paul Wise.
<li>Remove curr_param_result property of StatementClass and separate parsed result from the exec result.</li>
<li>Add support for development with VC16(Visual Studio 2019).</li>
MSToolsVersion parameter of BuildAll.ps1 and of regress.ps1 are deprecated.
<li>Hold the first and last result for parametrized SQL statements with array of parameters. </li>
This would improve the performance of bulk inserts/updates etc.
<li>Revise the handling of QResultClass list.</li>
Introduce macros QR_concat(), QR_detach() and QR_next().
<li>Correct the handling of SQL_ROW_ERROR and SQL_ROW_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.</li>
<li>Remove the single table restriction in SC_set_SS_columnkey.</li>
<li>Improve error reporting about SC_pos_reload_needed().</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="12.02.0000">psqlODBC 12.02.0000 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a new *Display Optional Error Message* option. </li>
This option allows to
display error messages other than primary one.
Also add documentation about the option and *Numeric as* option.
<li>Handle notice messages in libpq_bind_and_exec().</li>
Sets and resets a notify receiver around PQexecParams() or PQexecPrepared().
<li>Ignore PQtransactionStatus PQTRANS_ACTIVE in LIBPQ_update_transaction_status().
PQTRANS_ACTIVE isn't a transaction status.</li>
<li>Improve execution of parameterized SQL statements with arrays of parameters by sending chunks of SQL statements.</li>
If SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE of an statement is SQL_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY, SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY is SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY and extended protocol isn't used, the batch execution of the statement is possible.
A new option Batch Size was introduced for such cases.<br />
 Batch Size: Split an array (of parameters) into chunks of Batch Size to execute statements. The last chunk may contain less than Batch Size elements. Setting 1 to this option forces the current one by one execution.<br />
Also turn off use_server_side_prepare option temporarily when batch execution is possible.
<li>Change SC_execute() so that it returns a return code which is not
affetced by the preceding results. It's necessary for batch execution
with arrays of parameters.</li>
<li>Add a new option IgnoreTimeout.</li>
Some tools issue issue SQLSetStmtAttr(.., SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT,,) internally and sometimes it's difficult for users to change the timeout value. You can disable the timeout by turning on this option.
<li>An improvement for psqlodbc developers. </li>
Make it possible to call some shell scripts from other directories.

Because queries calling currtid(2) like<br />
select .. from .. where ctid=currtid2(.., ..)<br />
cause Seq Scan, their execution may be very slow.<br />
It is better to execute queries using subqueries like<br />

some adjustment and support Visual Studio 2015 for Windows.
<li><b>Use SIZEOF_LONG_INT to check whether SQLROWSETSIZE exists.</b><br /></li>
SIZEOF_LONG_INT is defined in UnixODBC headers, while SIZEOF_LONG is defined
by psqlodbc's ./configure. In odbcapi.c, we use it to determine what format
modifier, %ld or %lld, to use for pointers. (Why don't we use %p?). We should
rely on our autoconf check for that. In odbcapi.c, however, the check should
match that in the ODBC headers, to determine whether SQLROWSIZE exists, so
we should use SIZEOF_LONG_INT.

Formerly the driver offered very simple bookmark support -- it is just
the current row number. Now the driver offers more verbose bookmarks which

(row number + CTID) or 16bytes (row number + CTID + OID), they are useful
in declare/fetch mode.
<li><b>a hack to handle boolean items in VBA with MS Access.</b><br /></li>

<h2><a id="09.05.0100">psqlODBC 09.05.0100 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Use libpq for all communication with the server</b><br /></li>
  Previously, libpq was only used for authentication. Using it for all
  communication lets us remove a lot of duplicated code. libpq is now
  required for building or using libpq.

  <li><b>Remove support for protocol versions older than 3.</b><br /></li>
  Protocol version 3 was introduced in PostgreSQL 7.4, so this means that we
  no longer support server versions 7.3 or older. This simplified the
  code, making maintenance easier.

  <li><b>Remove support for ODBC versions older than 3.51.</b><br /></li>
  The official binaries have been compiled in 3.51 mode for a very long time,
  so this has no effect on the official binaries.

  <li><b>Avoid one round-trip to the server when establishing connection.</b><br /></li>
  When connecting to a server, the driver used to issue a query to determine
  the client_encoding setting being used, but that was unnecessary because
  all supported server versions send that information as part of the connection
  handshake when a connection is established. Remove the extra query, which
  should make connecting over a high-latency link faster.

  <li><b>Report max length of 'name' fields correctly.</b><br /></li>
  PostgreSQL columns of type 'name', used e.g. in catalog tables to hold
  names of relations and other objects, were reported as having type
  VARCHAR(64). However, the real max length of a name field is only 63 bytes.

  <li><b>Remove 'Optimizer' configuration option</b><br /></li>
  You can use the generic ConnSettings option with value "set geqo=off", to
  disable GEQO.

  <li><b>Fix title in 32-bit Unicode drivers setup dialog</b><br /></li>
  The title on the 32-bit Unicode drivers's setup dialog on Windows
  incorrectly said "ANSI".

  <li><b>Don't export private symbols that are not part of the ODBC interface </b><br /></li>
  This was causing problems when the driver was loaded together with another
  dynamically loaded library with a function of the same name. This was
  reported to happen when loading the odbc_fdw foreign data wrapper into
  a PostgreSQL server, because both the PostgreSQL server and the ODBC driver
  contain a function called check_client_encoding().

  <li><b>Report a sensible SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH value for result set columns of type 'unknown'</b><br /></li>
  If a query returns a column of type 'unknown', as happens e.g. in a query
  like "select 'foobar' from table" where the datatype of the constant
  'foobar' is not specified, the SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH property of the column
  was returned as invalid. Report it the same as 'varchar' field with no
  explicit length, instead.

  <li><b>Fix quoting bugs in sending integer query parameters to server</b><br /></li>
  The drivers used to assume that if a parameter's SQL type is SQL_INTEGER
  or SQL_SMALLINT, the value does not require quoting when its send to the
  server. For example, "SELECT ?", with parameter 123 was translated to
  "SELECT 123", when UseServerSidePrepare was not enabled. However, there
  was no check that the query parameter in fact contained a valid integer,
  when replacing the parameter markers with their values. Also, in a query
  like "SELECT 0-?", a negative value needs to have parens around it, as in
  "SELECT 0-(-123)".

  <li><b>Don't reset autocommit when a connection is established</b><br /></li>
  If autocommit is disabled on a connection, by calling
  SQLSetConnectAttr(SQL_ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT, SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF, 0), before
  connecting with SQLDriverConnect(), autocommit was incorrectly reset back
  to on when the connection was established.

  <li><b>Send datatype information for query parameters, when known</b><br /></li>
  If a query parameter is bound with a specific SQL type, pass on that
  information to the server. This makes the behaviour of queries like
  "SELECT '555' &gt; ?" more sensible, where the result depends on whether the query parameter
  is interpreted as an integer or a string.

  <li><b>Use libpq defaults for Server, Username and Database settings</b><br /></li>
  Server, Username and Database settings can now be left empty, in which case
  the corresponding libpq defaults will be used. The libpq default is
  to connect to a local server over Unix domain sockets (on Unix systems)
  or to localhost over TCP/IP (on Windows), if Server is left empty. The
  default username is the current operating system user, and the database to
  connect to is a database with the same name as the user. These built-in
  defaults can be changed by environment variables, however.

  This is particularly useful for connecting to a local installation via Unix
  domain sockets, as that is the default when Server is left empty, and was
  difficult to configure otherwise.

  <li><b>Fix bug in parsing E'' literals</b><br /></li>
  The driver needs to parse a query string to determine whether a '?'
  character is a parameter marker, or if it's inside a quoted string or a
  SQL comment. This parsing did not correctly handle E''-style strings.

  <li><b>Remove 256 byte limit on the length of NOTICE messages</b><br /></li>
  There was a built-in limit of 256 bytes on the length of NOTICE messages
  received from the server. Strings larger than 256 bytes were not returned
  to the application. That limit has been removed.

  <li><b>Fix parsing of strings containing escaped quotes with Parse=1</b><br /></li>
  This fixes issues in extracting metadata like result set column names, with the Parse=1 option.

  <li><b>Fix connecting with a user or database name that contains spaces or quotes </b><br/></li>
  User and database names were not quoted correctly when building a connection
  string. A different method is now used for sending those parameters, which
  doesn't require quoting and escaping.

  <li><b>Remove support for so-called "premature execution"</b><br/></li>
  Premature execution was a method for getting information about a result set
  of a query, before SQLExecute() was called. That was always dangerous, as
  any side-effects of the query would happen, even if the application did
  not call SQLExecute() after all. With protocol version 3, there is a safer
  way to do this. This also removes the DisallowPremature configuration
  option, as the driver never does premature execution anymore.

  <li><b>Fix buffer overrun when the server reports an error message longer than 4096 bytes</b><br/></li>
  If the server returned an error longer than 4096 bytes, we would overrun
  the buffer by two bytes. If you're unlucky, that could lead to a crash.
  That consistently happened on Windows.

  <li><b>Improve parsing of INSERT INTO statements, for @@identity support</b><br/></li>
  The code that parses INSERT INTO statements, to extract the name of the
  target table, got confused by values containing dots, and other things.
  Improve the parsing support to handle a wider range of INSERT statements.

  <li><b>Fix crash in SQLTables() function, if search_path was set to a non-existent schema</b><br/></li>
  The server-side current_schema() function returns a NULL if search_path is
  set to a non-existent schema, and the driver code was not prepared for a
  NULL result.

  <li><b>Fix buffer overrun when connecting, and KeepaliveTime and KeepaliveInterval were both set</b><br/></li>

   If the server returned an error longer than 4096 bytes, we would overrun
   the buffer by two bytes. If you're unlucky, that could lead to a crash,
   and it consistently did on Windows.
   Per report from Andrus Moor.<br />

  <li><b>Set an error message when password is required to connect.</b><br/></li>
   In previous versions, if a connection fails because the server requires a
   password and no password was supplied.
   Per report from "PSequel Support".<br />

   <li><b>Improve parsing of INSERT INTO statements to support @@identity</b><br/></li>

   This reverts the behaviour of SQL_LONGVARBINARY parameters.<br />

   <li><b>Fix handling of return value in {? = CALL ... } syntax.</b><br/></li>

   When sending the query to the server, need to use the number of parameters
   calculated by build_libpq_bind_params(), which excludes the OUT parameter,
   rather than the original number of parameters.

<h2><a id="09.03.0400">psqlODBC 09.03.0400 Release</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Rip out broken retry/timeout logic in SOCK_wait_for_ready.</b><br /></li>
At a quick glance, the logic looked like retry with progressive timeout, but it was horribly broken. 
First of all, the timeout was only used if retry_count was passed as 0. And in that case, the timeout was 0. 
So retry_count == 0 actually meant "check if data can be read/written without blocking", while retry_count > 0 meant "sleep until data is available".
There was also some code to handle retry_count < 0, but that was dead code because none of the callers passed a negative value.
The hardcoded max. retry count of 30 retries was quite bogus too.
Filling the output buffer more 30 times is not necessary an error, and it's not clear that the ssl library could not return SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or
SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE more than 30 times.
Unlikely, yes, but possible. So, just rip out the retry_count and progressive timeout logic. Replace
the retry_count argument with a simple "should block?" argument. I didn't dare to remove the condition that we always wait if SSL is enabled, although
I don't understand that at all. But perhaps there's some well-hidden reason for that.
Per report from Prakash Itnal, although this just removes the broken code, and won't enable the kind of a timeout that he wanted.
<li><b>Clean up Windows makefiles.</b><br /></li>
Get rid of the CPU and CPUTYPE variables in win64.mak. Instead, assume that the TARGET_CPU variable has been set correctly in the environment.
TARGET_CPU is set by "setenv" script that comes with the Microsoft Visual Studio C compiler package.
It never worked to pass a "CPU=x86" and using a x64 compiler, for example, so seems better to determine the correct target
from the environment, than fail with a cryptic error message if the CPU argument and the environment don't match.
To build 32-bit binaries with win64.mak, simply do "setenv /x86" before running "nmake -f win64.mak".
Similarly, to build 64-bit binaries, use "setenv /x64".
It should now be possible to build both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries with win64.mak. 
Ideally, we could now remove win32.mak altogether, but there are small differences between win64.mak and win32.mak in the build options that
they use. I don't understand the differences enough to dare to remove win32.mak yet.
The CPU=AMD64 alias for x64 is no longer supported (as the whole parameter is now gone).
Also do whitespace & other cosmetic fixes to win32.mak and win64, to make them more similar. 
This helps when comparing the two with "diff".
Remove remains of the long-gone "MULTIBYTE" setting (it was misspelled in win64.mak, anyway)
<li><b>Fix crash if connection is closed while sending a query to the server.</b><br /></li>
Some functions reset conn->sock to NULL on a socket error, so we must not keep a copy of it in a local variable. 
Also, SOCK_get_id should check for NULL argument like all the rest of the SOCK_get/put_* functions.
<li><b>Rewrite the conversion functions between strings and SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT.</b><br /></li>
Aside from making the functions more readable and faster, this fixes a number of bugs:
<ol type="a">

reported by Walter Couto.</li>
<li>In binary->decimal conversion, a number with small precision but large scale caused a "Floating point exception".<br /></li>
<li>In binary->decimal conversion, building the final string was wrong, picking
up "digits" from outside the reserved stack space, if scale was larger than 40<br /></li>
<li>The param_string buffer allocated for the result of binary->decimal conversion was too small.<br /></li>

<li><b>Fix the problems using SQLFetch on prepared INSERT with RETURNING clause.</b><br /></li>
reported by John Smith.
<li><b>Fix use of server-queried version before connection.</b><br /></li>
psqlODBC attempted to use the version that's queried from the server before it was obtained from the server during the connection setup. Because the server
version is initialized to 0.0, tests for "server version >= 7.4" or "server version >= 6.4" using the PG_VERSION_LT macro were always returning false.
Instead, use PROTOCOL_64 and PROTOCOL_74 tests against conninfo. These don't offer any "greater than" form, so just test both. There's little point adding
anything prettier when it can all be removed when v1/v2 protocol support is removed soon anyway.
The main symptom of this issue was that psqlODBC was sending an invalid protocol message for the v3 protocol, "Q \0", causing the server to wait for
the second half of the length word forever. At connection close, the server
would emit:
<br />
&nbsp; unexpected EOF within message length word
<br />
This issue was observed while tracking down problems with XA transactions in MSDTC failing to commit after a successful prepare because an isolated tx 
created via getLockedXAConn() got stuck here, but is not confined to that problem.
<li><b>Don't use PG_VERSION_xx() macros in original_CC_connect().</b><br /></li>
it's not obtained from the server yet. This may fix another cause of the problem Craig Ringer reported.
<li><b>Fix bug in SQLCancel().</b><br /></li>
If one thread was busy executing a savepoint statement, while another thread calls SQLCancel() on the statement, SQLCancel() would try to release the
locks held by the other thread. That's extremely racy; if the other thread tries to increment/decrement the lock_CC_for_rb counter at the same time,
we could end up releasing the lock to many times or too few times. Also, releasing a pthread mutex from a different thread than the one who acquired
it is undefined behavior.
AFAICS the DiscardStatementSvp() call in SQLCancel() can be safely removed.
It's outright wrong and dangerous if the statement is busy executing in a different thread, and the other codepaths in PGAPI_Cancel() already call
DiscardStatementSvp().

<li><b>Fix bug with UseDeclareFetch=1 when a transaction is committed before fetch.</b><br /></li>
If a server cursor is closed before the application has fetched any rows from the result set, the "base" of the result set's cached rowset was off-by-one.
Also add a regression test for the same. This fixes the bug reported by Jan-Peter Seifert.
<li><b>Fix driver name mismatch between 32-bit ODBC app and 64-bit MSDTC host.</b><br /></li>
If the 32-bit driver runs on a 64-bit host within a 32-bit app running under SysWow64 then XA transactions will fail to recover.
That's because recovery is done by pgxalib.dll which runs with in MSDTC.exe - a 64-bit application. 
It connects to a DSN supplied by psqlODBC in EnlistInDtc_1pipe during DTC enlistment by the XA resource manager. 
This DSN uses the driver name of the client's ODBC driver - which is fine so long as the client and MSDTC architectures match. 
If they don't then MSDTC will fail to connect to Pg, so it'll never resolve transactions.
Traces of MSDTC will show RM_COMMIT_DELIVERY_FAILED_DUE_TO_CONNECTION_DOWN events.
Traces of pgxalib.dll will show xa_recover(..) being entered, followed by "SQLDriverConnect return=-1".

<li><b>Clear unused stuff from PgDtc_isolate() function.</b><br /></li>
Also add CC_initialize_pg_version() call after CC_copy_conninfo() so as to avoid the trouble caused by early PG_VERSION_xx() calls.
<li><b>Fix race condition in getting the current decimal separator.</b><br /></li>
The code to get the current decimal separator was not thread-safe. If two threads concurrently saw that the locale had changed, they might both try
to free() the same string.
This isn't a perfect fix, there's still a race condition if a thread changes the locale while another thread is running the psqlodbc code. But at least
this eliminates the race condition when the locale was changed earlier, not concurrently, and even if it is changed concurrently, this is less likely
to crash, depending on the way localeconv() is implemented in libc.
<li><b>Fix bug in building an abbreviated connection string.</b><br /></li>
Introduced by the keepalive-patch, which accidentally removed a line from sprintf format string. Caught by a compiler warning.
<li><b>Fix buffer overflow in SQLGetData.</b><br /></li>
If a PostgreSQL timestamp column is fetched using SQLGetData, into a SQL_C_CHAR output variable, with size of 20-22 bytes, the driver might
overrun the buffer by a few bytes with unusual timestamp values, with year < 0 or > 10000.
While at it, fix the truncation behavior for date/time/timestamp values so that if the output buffer is too small, we still write what fits and
truncate, instead of writing nothing. This is something that one might do on purpose, e.g. if you only want to fetch the year part of a date,
you might call SQLGetData() on a date column, with only 4 bytes long output buffer. (although we haven't heard any complaints from the field).
Also, if the output buffer is of type SQL_C_WCHAR, but the buffer length is odd, and we have to truncate, we didn't NULL-terminate the string.
Using an odd-sized buffer with SQL_C_WCHAR is a pretty unlikely thing to do, but nevertheless I think this is more correct behavior.

<li><b>Fix implicit casts between SQLCHAR and char. Don't rely on -Wno-pointer-sign.</b><br /></li>
<li><b>Pass the argument to isalpha/isspace etc. routines as unsigned char.</b><br /></li>
Per the C standard, the routine should be passed an int, with a value that's representable as an unsigned char or EOF.

 Unfortunately no compiler warns about that.<br />
<li><b>Use "function(void)" instead of "function()" to declare 0-arg functions.</b><br /></li>

<li><b> Remove common.o on "make clean"</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Change the default for UseServerSidePrepare to 1.</b><br /></li>
 The docs have recommended UseServerSidePrepare=1 for server versions 7.4 onwards, so it seems prudent to change the default so that people don't needto remember to specify it manually.<br />
 With UseServerSidePrepare=1, the "insertreturning" regression test case behaves better, ie.<br />
 SQLNumResultCols() correctly returns the number of columns for an INSERT RETURNING statement, even when called before SQLExecute(). <br />
<li><b> Remove useless 'sync' parameter from prepareParameters() function. It was always passed as TRUE.</b><br /></li>
<li><b> Don't issue a BEGIN when running VACUUM in auto-commit mode.</b><br /></li>
Normally in auto-commit mode the driver begins a new transaction implicitly at the first statement, by sending a BEGIN statement. However,
some commands, like VACUUM, cannot be run in a transaction block, and you will get an error like "VACUUM cannot run inside a transaction block" from
the server. In UseServerSidePrepare=0 mode, the code looks at the first word of the query to determine if the statement is one of the special ones, and
if so, didn't begin a new transaction even when auto-commit mode is disabled. However, in UseServerSidePrepare=1 mode, when using SQLPrepare/
SQLExecute to run the VACUUM, that check was not made. Fix that.
There was one more related inconsistency between UseServerSidePrepare modes. Without server-side-prepares, if you issued an explicit BEGIN in auto-commit
mode, the implicit BEGIN was ont sent. But without server-side prepares, it was. It seems best to send the implicit BEGIN in both cases, because then
you get a warning from the backend about the second BEGIN. That's a good thing, because a sane ODBC application should be using the ODBC function
SQLEndTran() for transaction control, not explicit BEGIN/COMMIT.<br />
<li><b> When LF->CR+LF conversion causes an buffer truncation, suppress the conversion (in case of unicode).</b><br /></li>

<h2><a id="09.02.0100">psqlODBC 09.02.0100</a></h2>
Changes:<br />
1.) Protect shared connection list when making cleanup tasks in EN_Destructor
using the patch provided by Michael Kocherov.<br />
2.) Fix a lot of compiler warnings. Most of them were harmless, but some pointed
    to real, but rare, bugs.<br />
3.) Check SIZEOF_LONG_INT, rather than SIZEOF_VOID_P, when deciding whether
    SQLROWSETSIZE exists. That's consistent with unixodbc's sqltypes.h.<br />
4.) Check BUILD_LEGACY_64_BIT_MODE instead of BUILD_REAL_64_BIT_MODE. This
    makes us choose correctly whether we're building a 32-bit or 64-bit version,
    when building with unixODBC version 2.2.13 or higher.<br />
5.) Fix handling of some out-of-memory situations.<br />
6.) Eliminate recursion when freeing result sets of queries with
    array-bound parameters. This avoids running out of stack space on
    SQLFreeHandle, and speeds it up considerably.<br />
7.) Fix memory leak, e.g when SQLNumResultCols is called on a non-SELECT query.
    This was caused by unintentional multiple evaluation of macro arguments.<br />
8.) Move psqlodbc website's main page, FAQ, and howto pages to a separate git
    repository. They are no longer included in psqldbc release tarballs.<br />
9.) Fix bug with binding a 5-bytes long string as VARCHAR parameter, with
    UseServerSidePrepare=0 and BoolsAsChar=1. That combination produced an
    extra empty result set on execution.<br />
10.) Make the MSI build process of 32bit drivers available in 64bit.<br />
11.) Fix bug with DeUseDeclareFetch=1 and UseServerSidePrepare=1, issue COMMIT commands properly in case of AUTOCOMMIT on mode. per reported by Jack Wilson(ljwilson@digitalav.com).<br />
12.) Don't #include errno.h on Windows. VC10 or later intentionally changed the values of error numbers like EINTR, EWOULDBLOCK.<br />
13.) Allow special characters in the password value of a connection string by enclosing the value by braces({}).<br />
14.) Fixed conflict between winsock2.h and winsock.h in socket.c.<br />
15.)Apply blank date <-> null conversion functionality to timestamp type as well.<br />
16.) Fix the *cursor XXXXXXXX already exists* error when handling *with cte* statements reported by Joe Conway.<br />
17.) Fixed the problem *Segmentation Fault in Postgres server when using psqlODBC* reported by Joshua Berry.<br />
18.) Fixed the problem *UseDeclareFetch=1, Fetch=100, UseServerSidePrepare=1 causes Windows client to intermittently hang* reported by Jack Wilson.<br />
